# Visual Symptom Tracker

A web application built on ruby on rails for tracking symptoms over time in relation to events/factors which could be anything from medication, sleep, exercise or stress. By visualising the symptoms over time alongside these factors, users can identify patterns and make appropriate lifestyle changes or use this to inform doctors for professional advice.
